On this implementation we used authlogic for authentication,
paperclip for assets uploads,
bluecloth for markup chunks of text, and basic user roles.


### Roles

Simple users roles system that understands whether a user is and admin or not. This will control the actions that the user could take, as
well as layouts in the view.

Ajax implementations for setting a user as an admin.
